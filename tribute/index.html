          Long before TAYA became one of UNITED’s most acclaimed and impactful
          vocalists, with over one billion streams and numerous world tours over
          the last decade, her journey with Jesus began in the small town of
          Lismore, Australia. Her mother led her in the sinner’s prayer at age
          five and she attended a small community church with her family where
          her father was an elder & worship leader.

          The singer grew up listening to the local radio stations, her father’s
          record collection (Fleetwood Mac, Beatles) and classical music. Even
          before her six years of classical piano and cello studies, TAYA would
          spontaneously make up and sing songs around the house. She credits her
          high school music teacher for calling her out, encouraging her talent
          and teaching her how to harmonize.<span id="dots">....</span>

          <span id="more">
            After starting to lead worship in her high school years, TAYA cried
            out to God to use her: “I love to sing but whatever you want God.” A
            few years later, she got her first taste of performing publicly
            before thousands, throughout Australia and New Zealand, traveling as
            a backing vocalist for an R&B artist. As much as she enjoyed it, she
            couldn’t shake the strong feeling she associated with singing
            faith-based songs. Prompted by the still, ever faithful voice of God
            in her life, TAYA left Lismore for bustling Sydney at the age of 21
            with only $200 dollars to her name and a very specific goal: to make
            music her career. Not wanting to just attend a church, TAYA began
            serving as a youth leader in her local church on Friday nights when
            she was off from her retail job. While setting her hopes for secular
            musical success by auditioning for the Australian version of “The
            Voice” – which she whimsically notes, ultimately rejected her – her
            church began offering her opportunities to share her gifts,
            culminating in UNITED longtime producer & guitarist, Michael Guy
            Chislett, inviting her first to sing backing vocals on a recording
            project (which turned into UNITED’s Zion album) then singing lead on
            the song that became the group’s record breaking worship anthem of
            the decade, “Oceans (Where Feet May Fail).”</span
